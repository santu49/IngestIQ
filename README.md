                                                            Metadata-Driven Data Ingestion Process

Problem Statement:-
Write a metadata-driven data ingestion process to source data from a system and load into a target system. This should also work on any cloud (AWS).

Source and target data formats could be any of the below:

•	File formats: csv, parquet

•	RDBMS: table, SQL join query (PostgreSQL or mySQL or any open-source DB)


Introduction:-

Data ingestion is the process of collecting and importing data from various sources into a storage or processing system. It is a crucial first step in any data pipeline or data integration project, as it determines the quality, completeness, and accuracy of the data that will be used in subsequent processing and analysis.
 
Data ingestion can involve a wide range of sources, including databases, data warehouses, cloud-based storage systems, and various types of data files, such as CSV, Paraquet files and  JSON. Ingested data may be structured or unstructured, and can come from internal or external sources.
Effective data ingestion requires careful planning and execution, as well as appropriate tools and technologies to manage and automate the process. The success of data ingestion is critical for downstream data analysis and business insights, making it an essential step in any data-driven organization.


Data ingestion is a critical process in any data-driven organization as it enables organizations to collect and analyze large amounts of data from various sources, which can be used to make data-driven decisions and gain insights into customer behavior, product performance, and other important business metrics.

Technologies used:-

•	Scala

•	Spark

•	AWS

•	Postgresql


  Features :-
1.	Data Format Support: The ability to handle different data formats such as CSV, JSON, and Paraquet formats.

2.	Scalability: The ability to handle large volumes of data and scale as the data grows.

3.	Error Handling: The ability to handle errors that occur during the data ingestion process, Such as the data format errors and data validation errors.

4.	Data Validation: The ability to validate data during ingestion, such as checking for data consistency, data completeness and data accuracy.

5.	Alerting: The ability to send when errors or issues occur during the data ingestion process.

Use Cases :-
1.	Data Warehousing:  Our application can be used for data warehousing and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes. This can help businesses to efficiently manage and analyze large amounts of data from various sources.
	
       -For example, In an organization if company need to pickup the ten best performers in a year, then we can use our application. A company must have lots of data . First we need to load the data into the csv file then by using our application we can transfer the data from csv file to postgresql. In the postgresql by using the SQL query, we can get the top ten best performers in an easy manner.

2.	Business Intelligence: Our application can be used for real-time data processing, which can be helpful for businesses that need to react quickly to changing market conditions or other events.


3.	Predictive Analytics: Our application can be used for predictive analytics, which involves analyzing historical data to make predictions about future events or trends.
	
     -We can use our application for the predictive analytics. Suppose consider McDonald’s need to take the decision to increase the price of the product in the next year. For that first they need to analyze the historical data. Actually, the data is in different formats, so by using our application we can convert that data into the structured formats. By using that data we can analyze and predict the price of the product for the next year.
